### qp_to_hats is a utility for converting probabilistic ensembles generated using qp into formats compatible with HATS via LSDB. This tool facilitates transforming ensemble data into nested-pandas NestedFrames, managing multiple distribution formats (e.g., norm, hist, interp, mixmod, quant), and saving them for spatial querying in LSDB catalogs.
